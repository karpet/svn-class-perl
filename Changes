Revision history for SVN-Class

0.01    27 Sept 2007
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    16 Oct 2007
        Added missing .pm files to MANIFEST (did I just ignore make distcheck?)
        t/01-svn.t only runs if svn is found in PATH

0.03    16 Oct 2007
        Added missing Path::Class::File::Stat to dependency list.


0.04    17 Oct 2007
        Prefix all svn_run() calls with LANG=C to standardize svn output.
        Thanks to uwe.voelker@gmx.de for the fix.

0.05    18 Oct 2007
        **dev release only** -- turned on debugging in tests

0.06    17 Jan 2008
        * documented all the accessors in SVN::Class
        * turned off debugging in tests

0.07    13 Feb 2008
        * added SVN::Class::Info and parent info() method
        * added outstr() method
        * added SVN::Class::Repos

0.08_01 4 July 2008
        * **developer release only** -- trying to track down 50% fail rate in CPANTS.
        * no idea why tests fail after 20 tests in t/01-svn.t
          so switched to File::Temp for that test, along with using local
          repos for author test.
        * turned on debugging for tests.

0.08_02 7 July 2008
        * another debugging release

0.08_03 10 July 2008
        * dumb error after all. Needed to SKIP the right number of tests when svn bin not found.

0.08    22 July 2008
        * no code changes, just an official release now that 0.07 test snafu is resolved.

0.09    16 Oct 2008
        * fix bug with commit() not passing opts on to svn_run()
        * fix bug with status() returning wrong value if $obj is dir

0.10    22 Nov 2008
        * catch SIG{CHLD} issue when running under CatalystX::CMS by local()izing sig handler

0.11    24 Nov 2008
        * set success value if undef, always.

0.12    3 Feb 2009
        * added IPC::Run to Makefile for Win32 cpan testers

0.13_01 4 Feb 2009
        * some debugging for Win32

0.13_02 10 Feb 2009
        * drop Class::Accessor::Fast in favor of Rose::Object since we already required
          Rose::Object via Rose::URI. One less dependency, plus Rose::Object now has an XS
          option if Class::XSAccessor is installed.

0.13_03 xxx
        * Class::XSAccessor now triggers Pod::Coverage warnings if methods are documented.
          Added docs in SVN::Class::Info.
        * made stdout/stdin aliasing conditional based on SVN_CLASS_ALIAS_STDOUT env var.
          default is now *off* so that things work as you would expect, and the hack
          of aliasing them now used only when explicitly asked for.
        * added Text::ParseWords to Makefile deps so IPC::Run works.
