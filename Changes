Revision history for SVN-Class

0.01    27 Sept 2007
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    16 Oct 2007
        Added missing .pm files to MANIFEST (did I just ignore make distcheck?)
        t/01-svn.t only runs if svn is found in PATH

0.03    16 Oct 2007
        Added missing Path::Class::File::Stat to dependency list.


0.04    17 Oct 2007
        Prefix all svn_run() calls with LANG=C to standardize svn output.
        Thanks to uwe.voelker@gmx.de for the fix.

0.05    18 Oct 2007
        **dev release only** -- turned on debugging in tests

0.06    17 Jan 2008
        * documented all the accessors in SVN::Class
        * turned off debugging in tests

0.07    13 Feb 2008
        * added SVN::Class::Info and parent info() method
        * added outstr() method
        * added SVN::Class::Repos

0.08_01 4 July 2008
        * **developer release only** -- trying to track down 50% fail rate in CPANTS.
        * no idea why tests fail after 20 tests in t/01-svn.t
          so switched to File::Temp for that test, along with using local
          repos for author test.
        * turned on debugging for tests.

0.08_02 7 July 2008
        * another debugging release

0.08_03 10 July 2008
        * dumb error after all. Needed to SKIP the right number of tests when svn bin not found.

0.08    22 July 2008
        * no code changes, just an official release now that 0.07 test snafu is resolved.
